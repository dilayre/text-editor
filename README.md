<h1> Simple Text File Editor </h1>

<h2> What the program can do </h2> 

* Show all records in the file
* Add new record (name, job, phone)
* Delete a record by number
* Update a record (name, job or phone)
* Save changes automatically
* Exit the program

<h2> How it works </h2> 

1. When the program starts, it asks for a file name.
2. If the file exists, it reads the text.
3. If the file does not exist, it starts with empty content.
4. The menu shows five simple options.
5. When you add a record, you write it like:

   ```
   name | job | phone
   ```
6. The program gives the record a number and saves it to the file.
7. Delete and update options work with the record number.
8. All changes are saved automatically to the same file.

<h3> Example of a record </h3>

1. Ad: Elvin
Peşe: Proqramçı
Telefon: +994 50 123 45 67
